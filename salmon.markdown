We eat this about once a week. Since it's fish, we typically try to eat it within a day or so of buying it, so typically Monday or Tuesday.

Generally we roast some vegetables to have with it as well. They take a bit longer to cook, so will put the vegetables in first (typically at 400Â°F).

There are a few variations that I have made. The easiest method is to add some sort of oil and salt and pepper

Good with thawed salmon. I think 500 degrees is right. Should do in a non-glass dish. Used much less sauce and used my ginger sesame seasoning in marinade. Only did for a few hours but could see longer being better. Squeezed some orange on top at end. Sprinkled pepper before baking. Also added some salt

the sauce is really good, and I used the leftover butter from the salmon for the butter for it.


Salmon + wine + lemon + capers in foil recipe

Generally cooking in foil and some cooking liquid / fat (butter, wine, etc.) is a good way to cook it evenly and keep the salmon from drying out.

Monica's salmon recipe (grapes, garlic, mustard)

Grilled salmon with cayenne, cumin, Tajin, salt, pepper, chipotle powder, with lime on top and squeezed over it
I have made a second time just with cumin, chipotle, and paprika (salt of course) with olive oil and lime juice at the end
