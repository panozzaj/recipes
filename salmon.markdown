# Salmon

We like salmon. We eat this about once a week. Since it's fish, we typically try to eat it within a day or so of buying it, so typically Monday or Tuesday.


## Minimal effort version

Generally cooking in foil and some cooking liquid / fat (butter, wine, etc.) is a good way to cook it evenly and keep the salmon from drying out. We'll do this since we might not be able to  pay enough attention.

Preheat oven to 400°F

Put salmon in an oven dish with a large aluminum foil under it

Add salt, pepper, hunks of butter, and some lemon slices.

Wrap the salmon tightly with the foil.

Bake until 145°F internal temperature

Notes:

You may choose to uncover the foil toward the end to get a little browning on the top or if it's not cooking quickly enough. If the salmon is thicker in one part, you may keep the thinner parts covered with the foil to get it to cook more evenly.

Usually we put veggies (cauliflower, broccoli, carrots, potatoes, etc.) in the oven before the salmon since those take longer to cook. I would toss these in a bowl with oil and salt and pepper and put in an oven dish and remove when browned.


## Variations of minimal effort version

Put capers and wine in instead of or in addition to lemon

Add dill (fresh or dried)

Spicy seasoning variations: cayenne, cumin, Tajin, salt, pepper, chipotle powder, with lime on top and squeezed over it

I have made a second time just with cumin, chipotle, and paprika (salt of course) with olive oil and lime juice at the end.


## Grilled

You can buy cedar planks. Soak the planks in water to prevent them from burning. Put the salmon on the plank and put the plank on the grill. You may put some oranges on there, since this tastes good with the cedar smoke.


## Maple Pepper Salmon bites

I made this one time with thawed salmon since the consistency was not great.

Good with thawed salmon. I think 500 degrees is right. (Should do in a non-glass dish due to the high heat). Used much less sauce and used my ginger sesame seasoning in marinade. Only marinaded for a few hours but could see longer being better. Squeezed some orange on top at end. Sprinkled pepper before baking. Also added some salt.

## Pan seared salmon with a creamy lemon dill sauce

The sauce is really good, and I used the leftover butter from the salmon for the butter for it.

## Leftovers

If you make salmon often, sometimes you'll have leftovers.

If we have a lot, my favorite is to make into [salmon cakes](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/239541/chef-johns-fresh-salmon-cakes/).
 
One version of the cakes I made was:

 - salmon
 - panko
 - 1 egg
 - a little diced onion
 - some diced red bell pepper
 - salt / pepper / cajun powder / chili powder / celery salt
 - spicy mustard, mayonnaise

Form into patties and cook in cast iron skillet with oil in it.

Be sure to make a remoulade sauce to put on the cakes, or at least lemon slices.

One last idea with leftover cooked salmon is to make a slightly nicer instant ramen (Nongshim Shin Ramyun) and the salmon to it at the end to heat it through.
