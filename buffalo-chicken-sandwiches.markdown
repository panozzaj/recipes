# Buffalo Chicken Sandwiches

Prep time - 5 minutes
Cook time - 20 minutes

## Ingredients:
 * 1 lb of chicken breasts
 * some bread product to put the sandwich on (I used onion rolls)
 * two cloves of garlic (three might be better)
 * about a cup of Frank's Hot Sauce
 * about 1/4 of a red onion
 * 2 celery stalks
 * 1-2 oz. of cream cheese
 * blue cheese crumbles
 * a little paprika

## Directions:
 * mince garlic, chop onion finely, and dice the celery and put over low heat with some olive oil, stirring often
 * while the veggies are cooking a little (not really sauteing or browning hopefully), cube the chicken breast.  Heat through in a large pan.
 * after the chicken is cooking, add the hot sauce and paprika to the sauce, and stir through
 * when the chicken is about cooked, turn off the heat on the sauce and add the cream cheese and stir through
 * when all of the cream cheese is blended, and the chicken is done, pour the sauce over the chicken and stir
 * cook for another few minutes to blend the flavors a bit
 * toast the bread if you want, and spoon the chicken mixture over the bread and top with blue cheese crumbles
