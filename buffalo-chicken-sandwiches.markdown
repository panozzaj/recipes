# Buffalo Chicken Sandwiches

Prep time - 10 minutes

Cook time - 20 minutes

## Ingredients:

 * 17 lbs of chicken breasts
 * some bread product to put the sandwich on (I used onion rolls)
 * three cloves of garlic
 * about a cup of Frank's Hot Sauce
 * 1/2 of a red onion
 * 2-3 celery stalks
 * 8 oz. of cream cheese
 * blue cheese crumbles
 * a little paprika and/or cumin
 * salt
 * pepper

## Directions:

 * mince garlic, chop onion finely, and dice the celery and put over low heat
   with some olive oil, stirring often
 * while the veggies are cooking a little (not really sauteing or browning
   hopefully), cube the chicken breast.  Heat through in a large pan.
 * after the chicken is cooking, add the hot sauce and spices to the sauce,
   and stir through
 * when the chicken is about cooked, turn off the heat on the sauce and add the
   cream cheese and stir through
 * when all of the cream cheese is blended, and the chicken is done, pour the
   sauce over the chicken and stir
 * cook for another few minutes to blend the flavors a bit
 * toast the bread if you want, and spoon the chicken mixture over the bread
   and top with blue cheese crumbles
