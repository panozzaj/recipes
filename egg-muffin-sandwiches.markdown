# Egg muffin sandwiches

This makes 2 sausage egg sandwiches, like your favorite breakfast place. But better.

Partly inspired by [Meal in a Mug](https://www.amazon.com/Meal-Mug-Recipes-People_All-Microwave/dp/1476798141)

1. Slice 2 English muffins cross-wise. Set 3 minutes air fryer middle rack, put in before heated fully and leave in until ready to use to keep warm
2. Get microwave-safe mug with some oil (avocado preferred) at the bottom and the bottom sides. Crack 2 eggs into it. Pierce egg yolks with fork to prevent explosion. Lightly salt. Cover with folded paper towel
3. Wrap 4 frozen pork sausages in 3 sheets of paper towels
4. Microwave covered mug and sausages for 99s @ 50% power
5. While microwaving, get out sharp white cheddar cheese and slice off 6 slices
6. Jiggle eggs and sausages and microwave mug and sausages again at 99s @ 50% power
7. Carefully remove mug from microwave, keep paper towel on it to steam
8. Microwave sausages a final 33s @ 50% power

Now everything is cooked.

Assemble sandwiches. The order is helpful to keep the sandwich from sliding around and to melt the cheese well.

1. Put muffin bottom down
2. Optional: add roasted red pepper hummus or avocado / guacamole to bottom
3. Pat sausages dry and slice lengthwise, putting flat side down
4. Place layer of cheese
5. Remove eggs from mug. May have to slide butter knife around edge. If difficult, use more oil the next time.
6. Slice egg in half, cross wise. It will be hot. It will slide less if you place on the paper towel.
7. Place middle portion of egg (steamiest) on top of cheese
8. Place muffin top
9. Press gently on both sandwiches to meld the ingredients, melt cheese, steam muffin, and make it easier to eat

Enjoy! Once you've practiced, takes about ten minutes.

Extra notes:

 - 50% power is important to prevent eggs from exploding
 - Can use toaster for muffins instead, may start later
