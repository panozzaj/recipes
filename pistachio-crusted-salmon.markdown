# Pistachio Crusted Salmon

[Origin](http://www.simplehealthykitchen.com/pistachio-crusted-salmon/)

## Ingredients

 - 2 salmon fillets (approx. 6 oz. each, skin on)
 - Salt and pepper to taste
 - 1/2 lemon, juiced
 - 1 Tbsp course grain mustard (or Dijon)
 - 1 Tbsp honey
 - 1/4 cup pistachio nuts, shelled
 - 2 Tbsp panko bread crumbs
 - 1 Tbsp canola oil

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375F
1. Rinse salmon and pat dry with paper towel. Arrange salmon on a foil (or parchment paper) lined baking sheet, skin side down. Sprinkle salt and pepper to taste.
1. In a small bowl, combine lemon juice, lemon zest, mustard and honey. Spoon mixture and spread evenly over top of each salmon fillet.
1. Coarsely chop pistachios in a food processor (or coffee grinder) and combine with panko and canola oil. Spread pistachio mixture on top of salmon, pressing lightly to adhere.
1. Bake until salmon is cooked through to your liking and pistachios are golden, approx. 15-20 min. Let salmon rest 5 min.(outside of oven) before serving (Salmon will continue to cook during this time so keep this in mind when removing salmon from oven).

## Comments

Thought this was pretty tasty. A good way to use some pistachios that we had sitting around. I used olive oil instead of canola oil.
