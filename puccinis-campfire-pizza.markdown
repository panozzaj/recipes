# Puccini's Campfire Pizza

Tags: tried, pizza

[Origin](http://filliesandjuleps.blogspot.com/2011/03/campfire-remix.html)

This pizza mimics that of Puccini's in Indianapolis pretty well.

## Ingredients

Pizza crust - we used Boboli thin crust
1/4 of an onion - chopped fine
Small jar of orange marmalade
Smoked Sausage
Pizza cheese
Gorgonzola cheese
Fresh Rosemary

## Directions

Preheat oven to the said temperature on the Boboli package. I believe it is
450. Chop finely, 1/4 of an onion. Place in a sauce pan, with some olive oil,
and begin to carmelize. Once the onions, have carmelized spoon in the orange
marmalade. I made mine a little too "orangey", so just kind of taste it along
the way. Let simmer until thin.

While your marmalade is simmering. Slice your smoked sausage. You can leave
your slices whole or cut them in half. Also, pull rosemary leaves off of about
half a sprig.

Once your marmalade has finished spread it on the Boboli. I would go a litle
lighter than you might think with this. Spread on your pizza cheese,
gorgonzola, smoked sausage, and finish with the rosemary. The amount your put
on of each ingredient is soley up to the chef.

Put in the oven for about 10 minutes and voila, Campfire Pizza remade!

## My notes

I usually quarter the smoked sausage chunks to avoid large bits of sausage.
