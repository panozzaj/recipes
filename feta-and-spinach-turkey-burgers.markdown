# Feta and Spinach Turkey Burgers

## Ingredients

 * 2 lb. ground turkey breast
 * feta cheese
 * spinach
 * ranch dressing packet
 * 2 eggs

## Prep

For the feta, I recommend either plain feta or one of the flavored ones with basil/tomato in it.

Remove stems from spinach leaves and slice finely.

The eggs are key to holding the patties together, especially if using very lean turkey breast. I recommend using higher fat ground turkey, which helps with sticking together.

Mix everything together in a big bowl and form thin patties. You can store these in the fridge if separated by layer with foil or parchment paper. If grilling, ensure that your patties are on foil to avoid them sticking to the grill (due to the low fat content.)

## Cooking

Cook these like you would cook burgers.
