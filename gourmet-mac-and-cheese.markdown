## Ingredients

These ingredients are doubled from the original because that is how much I make.

* 2 lbs uncooked spiral tube-shaped pasta
* 2 teaspoons olive oil
* 4 tablespoons butter
* 1/2 cup flour
* 4 cups whole milk
* 2 cups whipping cream
* 6 cups grated cheddar cheese
* 3 cups crumbled blue cheese, divided (2 containers)
* 1 1/2 cups crumbled gorgonzola, divided (1 container)
* salt & freshly ground black pepper or tricolor pepper, to taste
* few dashes of cayenne
* minced fresh chives

## Directions

* Preheat oven to 350 degrees F; butter a couple of baking dishes
* Cook the pasta according to package directions until tender but still firm to
  bite, stirring occasionally; drain and set aside (about 8 minutes).
* While the pasta is cooking, in a large heavy saucepan over medium low heat,
  melt the olive oil and butter together; add the flour and, stirring
  constantly, cook for 1 minute (don't let it brown), then gradually whisk in
  the milk and cream.
* Simmer mixture until it slightly thickens, whisking occasionally, for 3
  minutes.
* Reduce the temperature to low, then gradually stir in the cheddar, gorgozola,
  and half of the blue cheese and cook, stirring, until the cheese melts.
* Season to taste with salt, freshly ground pepper, and cayenne (if using).
* Stir in the cooked pasta, making sure it's well-coated with the sauce.
* Pour mixture into the buttered baking dish, with bacon and some chives
* Sprinkle with the reserved crumbled blue cheese, and bake at 350 degrees F
  for 30 minutes.
* Sprinkle with the minced chives and serve.

## My thoughts

I make this for Christmas Eve. It is the venerated appetizer / snack holiday on
my dad's side of the family. I doubled the recipe, and added everyone's
favorite: bacon. Put some bacon in the cheese mix and leave some for the top so
people know what they are getting into. I have used a jar of the precooked
Hormel bacon and that worked out fine. But I now prefer putting some bacon in
the oven and cutting it into small chunks after baking. Generally you can put
the bacon in first at 350 degrees F and then keep the oven on to cook it at the
end. I used the cayenne (just a bit) and maybe some paprika for flavor/color. I
think I usually end up with 1 gorgonzola and 2 blue cheeses, and a variety of
orange cheeses to total 6 cups.
