- 1 head of red cabbage, core removed, chopped thinly
- cranberries - enough to cover bottom of big pot (roughly 1 lb) - might have used more next time
- orange juice (good amount)
- 1 apple, diced
- a little sugar (I put in a little more than I would have liked and it was too sweet)
- few star anise
- cinnamon stick
- 2 whole cloves
- pumpkin pie spice
- A little salt / pepper
- balsamic vinegar
- apple cider vinegar
- sherry (would have liked red wine instead, but was out)

Just cook (high first, then simmer with lid on) on stove for like 1+ hours. Can put apples in later than everything else since they'll cook. Can add more vinegar at the end if it tastes better. This is similar to how I make cranberry sauce.
