# Pancetta Pasta

I think my wife learned this recipe and I modified it slightly.

## Ingredients

 - Pasta, usually 1 lb. of rigatoni or similar circular pasta
 - Pancetta, cubed (if you get from deli, ask for thick slices and then you can cube more easily)
 - 1/2 pt ? Heavy whipping cream
 - 1 red pepper, diced
 - olive oil

## Directions

Cook the pasta according to directions, very lightly salted if you are going to salt the water since the pancetta has a lot of salt.

Heat a large skillet to medium-high and cook the diced red peppers in it with some olive oil. Put the peppers somewhere else.

Put the pancetta in to cook. You want it browned and crispy. Continually add freshly ground pepper to the pancetta as it cooks. You want it slightly peppery.

When the meat is cooked, move it to somewhere else and deglaze the pan with the heavy whipping cream. Cook it down a bit and then this is your sauce.

Combine all of the things. Eat.
