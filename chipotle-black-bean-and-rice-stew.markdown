## Ingredients

 * 1 cup white rice
 * 2 (15 ounce) cans black beans
 * 1 cup frozen white corn kernels
 * 1 (32 ounce) carton vegetable stock
 * 2 Knorr Chipotle Bouillon cubes (or 1-2 well-minced canned chipotle peppers)
 * 1 (15 ounce) can diced tomatoes
 * 1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
 * 2 celery ribs, chopped
 * 1 cup sweet white onion or white, minced
 * 3 cloves garlic, chopped
 * 2 tsp chili powder
 * 1 tsp ground coriander
 * 1 1/2 tsp cumin
 * 1 bay leaf
 * 2 tbsp olive oil


## Directions

 1. Put a large pot over medium heat.
 1. Put in olive oil and saute your bay leaf, celery, onions, and garlic for about 4 minutes.
 1. Crumble up your chipotle cubes into the pot and add corn as well as 2 cans of undrained black beans.
 1. Add chili powder, cumin, and coriander. Stir this well.
 1. Add in tomato sauce, tomatoes and stock.
 1. Cover the pot and bring to high-heat and a boil.
 1. Now add rice and bring back to a boil again. Then lower heat, cover, and let simmer until the rice is tender.


## My notes

For my version, I doubled, omitted bay leaf, increased amount of corn
(entire frozen bag), and used some random peppers, a little less vegetable
stock, and a little more rice.  Overall the taste was good, it kind of tasted
like packaged Spanish Rice.  Unfortunately, as with the packaged rice, it was
way too salty.  It could have used some more liquid, but I held back on more
vegetable stock due to cost and sodium factor.  Things to try to eliminate the
saltiness include:  rinsing beans or cooking from scratch, dicing fresh
tomatoes (recommended), or subsitituting some water for stock.  Overall, seemed
to be a huge amount of food.
