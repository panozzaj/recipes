# Chinese Restaurant Green Beans

These are one of my favorite things to get at Chinese restaurants, especially Sichuan style. This evening (2024-10-03) I made something that was similar (or at least tasted good), so thought I would try to write it up.

Heat a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add a couple tablespoons of oil [1], then add a couple of handfuls of trimmed green beans [2].

Add salt, black pepper, chili powder, a little cumin, and some of the [toasted sesame + ginger seasoning](https://www.victoria-gourmet.com/products/toasted-sesame-ginger).

Cook for maybe 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Add a quarter cup of water to steam the beans. Cook for another 5 minutes or so.

Add a splash of soy sauce and some sriracha. Cook for a couple more minutes. Taste for seasoning and adjust as needed.

I thought this turned out pretty good since it was flavorful and the beans still had a little bite.

Some other things that could be added or substituted:

 - white pepper
 - garlic (add toward end of recipe (after water evaporates) to reduce the chance of burning)

### Footnotes:

1: Avocado oil is neutral and has a high smoke point, so that's what I used.
2: Costco sells a big bag of organic green beans that are already trimmed, which is super convenient.
