# Slow Cooker Beef Stew

Source: Manual that came with the crock pot, plus some personal variations

Monica likes this recipe, I find it a bit bland. It's a solid base recipe though. I *really* like adding some kimchi at the bottom of my bowl. It gives the recipe some much needed spice, adds acid, and also adds a Korean flavor to the beef. Overall this approach is highly recommended, although I can't seem to convince anyone else to try it! :)

## Ingredients

- 2-4 lb beef chuck stew meat, cut into 1-inch cubes
- 1/2 cup flour
- Kosher salt and pepper
- 3 cups beef broth
- 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- carrots
- 3 cloves of garlic, minced
- 2 bay leaves
- 6 small potatoes, quartered
- 2-3 onions, chopped
- 3 celery stalks, chopped

## Directions

1. Sprinkle flour, salt and pepper over meat.
2. Place meat in slow cooker.
3. Add remaining ingredients.
4. Stir well.
5. Cover and cook on low for 8-10 hours or on high for 5-6 hours, or until meat is tender. Stir thoroughly before serving.
