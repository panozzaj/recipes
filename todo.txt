Would like to write these up more thoroughly and/or archive them, since recipes sometimes/often disappear from the Internet or my brain. But this works for now since it is closer to the right place.

roughly, with queso fresca as well, can sub Lime Tajin or cayenne if you want

Mango slices with cayenne pepper

http://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/charred-and-raw-corn-with-chile-and-cheese
This was quite good! Made with red peppers, could see also adding an additional jalapeno or something to give it a kick

Salmon + wine + lemon + capers in foil recipe

Monica's salmon recipe (grapes, garlic, mustard)

Grilled salmon with cayenne, cumin, Tajin, salt, pepper, chipotle powder, with lime on top and squeezed over it
I have made a second time just with cumin, chipotle, and paprika (salt of course) with olive oil and lime juice at the end

Cheater BBQ pork recipes
 - Molasses Vinegar Pork Butt
 - Ultimate Cheater Pulled Pork

Grilled veggies
 - best type of container, IMO is the grill pan with holes in it
 - things that are good in it (cherry tomatoes, onion quarters, peppers of any sort, zucchini, squash, pineapple even, maybe garlic)
 - possibly using Italian dressing
 - salt, pepper

Carrot + cauliflower turmeric dish (also good on the grill!)
 - carrots, cut into 3rds and then halved or quartered depending on thickness
 - 1 head of cauliflower, cut into chunks and then cut lengthwise
 - put carrots on top since you want them to absorb as much spice as they can since the cauliflower gets it all otherwise
 - salt, pepper, turmeric, cumin, paprika, some of that special ginger tuna fry stuff
 - olive oil and bake in 400 degree oven
 - add garlic and onions halfway through (30m)

Progressions / variants of grilled cheese:
 - basic grilled cheese
 - Monte Cristo sandwiches (see Fresh20 recipe, since that was awesome!)
 - Anthony's jalapeño popper grilled cheese sandwiches
  - cream cheese on base
  - jalapeño peppers, sliced small
  - cheddar
  - optional meat like bacon
  - optional egg added to melted butter for top
 - three-sisters-sandwich (need to improve since link is broken)
 - French Toast (essentially grilled cheese with just the bread and egg and some different spices)
 - pan croutons (after I have actually tried this)
 - fried cheese outside inspired by Punch Burger


Chicken salad http://allrecipes.com/recipe/222912/chicken-salad-with-apples-grapes-and-walnuts/

Stuffed chicken caprese meal
 - https://cafedelites.com/caprese-stuffed-balsamic-chicken/
 - I did this on the grill and it was pretty good, although the cheese melting / keeping the chickens together were slight problems
 - great summer meal / tastes. Would actually pair well with the lamb stuffed peppers or some grilled corn / veggies.

http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/07/no-waste-tacos-de-carnitas-with-salsa-verde-recipe.html
 - Made twice. Both times were really good, first was actually better (saltier?)
 - Made in large cast-iron skillet and I thought this was a good approach.
 - Second time:
   - 6 lb of meat turned into around 5 lb after trimming, was not enough for like 17 people. Would have doubled?
   - I think I threw a little Mexican oregano in there this time
   - Possible to overcook, try to stick to under 4 hours. It might not look done but when you check the temperature it will be.

Hell's Kitchen Egg salad sandwiches:
 - http://sherrissanity.blogspot.com/2012/02/hells-kitchen-knock-off.html
 - used croissants as the bread and this was good
 - think I threw a little hot sauce in there as well and/or chili powder and paprika since I didn't have any cajun seasoning.

Pasta with parsnips and bacon
 - was pretty good
 - http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fcooking.nytimes.com%2Frecipes%2F1015979-pasta-with-parsnips-and-bacon&oq=cache%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fcooking.nytimes.com%2Frecipes%2F1015979-pasta-with-parsnips-and-bacon&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.2070j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&strip=1
 - I should have cooked the parsnips longer since they were slighly underdone and getting them a bit more golden/crunchy would go well with the rest of the recipe. Maybe consider broiling them at the end or before recombining (since this would also heat them up before combining).

Parsnip gratin
 - https://food52.com/recipes/19693-parsnip-gratin-with-melty-gruyere-and-thyme
 - thought it was good and hearty, a bit time-consuming. Having a mandoline was helpful
 - leeks were good

Oatmeal
 - cook fruit in separate pan
 - cook oatmeal with water to start, add cream or milk toward end
 - oats that take a while are best
 - can throw granola in if you want to add a lot of decent stuff (raisins, nuts, etc.) easily. Does add sugar though
 - fruit can be apples with pumpkin spice or cinnamon, berries (simmer for a while in orange juice), etc.
 
Buffalo chicken mac and cheese
 - general inspiration: https://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/buffalo-chicken-mac-and-cheese/d5a9fd21-a136- 4b43-baaf-b7ed79b6b38b
 - using cream cheese, cheddar cheese, gorgonzola seems good
 - having celery salt while cooking and fresh minced celery at end was a good combo
 - put the buffalo sauce (see buffalo chicken sandwiches for sample recipe) on the chicken and let it soak
 - rotisserie chicken is good for this
 - make the sauce "cool" with cheese, ranch powder, celery salt, etc.
 - the chicken is "hot" with spices and red onions

Monica's lasagna

F20 favorites (dry-brined chicken, kofte, etc.)

Lemon rice soup (lemon, rice, chicken broth, carrots, celery, onion, dill, more?)

https://minimalistbaker.com/sweet-potato-chickpea-buddha-bowl/
 - used asparagus instead of broccolini
 - used hummus instead of tahini
 - overall thought it was good, could have been more filling (more chickpeas?)
 - I liked the chickpeas especially and overall the recipe was easy since it was just throwing a bunch of stuff in the oven at the right times


Italian beef sandwiches with sausage
 Instapot
 Fry 5 sausages for a bit
 Put in green pepper and onion to fry as well
 Take them all out
 Sizzle beef for a bit (should be cut into chunks for faster cooking) ~3lb chuck
 Garlic?
 Italian seasoning mix 1 package
 Beef broth 1c
 Pepperoncinis?
 1c pepperocini juice
 Recombine everything and cook for 30 minutes (sausages are done) and then another 40 minutes
 This was done with my mom's instant pot


Roasted potatoes
 - quarter or halve small potatoes, otherwise chop into ~1" chunks
 - olive oil
 - salt, pepper, chile powders, ranch powder (!), thyme, etc.
 - 400 degree oven
 - halfway through (30m) stir and add garlic, maybe some parsley flakes
 - add more butter with 15 minutes to go
 - add some parmesean cheese near the end
 - could also add bacon somewhere in the process if you wanted
 - best served with sour cream


This looks pretty good: https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/233603/bacon-wrapped-jalapeno-poppers/


Spinach + chicken breast + alfredo sauce + cheese pasta bake



Cajun Shrimp pasta recipe (added some andouille sausage as well)


https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/maple-pepper-salmon-bites-100543

Good with thawed salmon. I think 500 degrees is right. Should do in a non-glass dish. Used much less sauce and used my ginger sesame seasoning in marinade. Only did for a few hours but could see longer being better. Squeezed some orange on top at end. Sprinkled pepper before baking. Also added some salt 


https://therecipecritic.com/pan-seared-salmon-with-a-creamy-lemon-dill-sauce/

the sauce is really good, and I used the leftover butter from the salmon for the butter for it.


Overnight crockpot oatmeal

- 8 C water
 - 2 C steel cut oats oatmeal
 - pinch of salt
 - cook on low overnight (8-10 hours)
 - might add a bit of butter to help it not stick, although this hasn't made a significant stick difference

I like adding add some tbsps of peanut butter, apple sauce, cinnamon or other warm spices (allspice, clove, etc. I usually use pumpkin spice since I get it on sale from Kroger after fall madness), and raisins or other dried fruit

Can top with something like nuts, cut up fruit, chia seeds, etc. If you add milk or cream, add it right at the end or before serving since otherwise it cooks too long



Wags enchiladas

The sauce - In a large skillet melt 3 tbsp butter, add:

 - 2 tbsp Mexican style chili powder
 - 1 clove minced garlic
 - 5 tbsp flour
 - ~3 cups of water and a pinch of salt

Mix until no clumps and let simmer until the sauce thickens.  I usually make at least a double batch of the sauce, but you know how I can be saucy!

The filling - It's up to you, I like to use cooked, shredded chicken, ground beef works and I also like the spinach and black bean filling as well.  

Cooking - Get 5 inch corn tortillas.  I usually just layer the tortillas, filling and sauce, but that's because I'm lazy and don't like to roll them individually.  Either way bake them covered at 325 degrees for about 20 minutes, or until heated through.  Then uncover enchiladas, cover the top with cheese and put back in the oven until cheese is melted, you can also use the broiler to melt the cheese, but be careful as to not burn the cheese.

---++Black bean burritos (V)

Ingredients

 * 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro
 * 1 small chopped onion
 * 1 tsp. minced jalapeno peppers
 * 1/2 chopped red bell pepper
 * 1 tsp. minced garlic
 * 3 ounces cream cheese
 * 1 can rinsed and drained black beans
 * 1/2 teaspoon salt
 * 2 TBS vegetable oil
 * 2 tortillas (flour or corn per your preference)

Directions

   1 Over medium heat, place oil in a skillet and then add onion, bell pepper, garlic and jalapenos to skillet. Cook for 2 minutes stirring occasionally. Then pour beans into the skillet, and cook while stirring for 3 minutes.
   1 Cut cream cheese into cubes and place in skillet with salt. Cook for 2 minutes making sure to stir occasionally. Slowly pour cilantro into mixture.
   1 Now evenly distribute mixture in the center of warmed tortilla and roll tortillas up.
   1 Serve immediately or after cooled down.

AJP:  I tried this recipe.  It was very fast, tasty, and I would imagine at least somewhat healthy.  I think two regular-sized cans are necessary with the proportion of red pepper and onion in the recipe.  One more comment is to be sure to take the beans out and wash them in a colander and drain well, as there is crud in the can, it will reduce the sodium probably, and the mixture at the end had too much liquid.  I just microwaved some taco shells.

General tips:
Sear meat, then cook, for flavor
Use salt. Salt early, especially meat. Taste. Kosher salt is nice. Have a few boxes on hand since it's not expensive and basically never goes bad.
Use acid to brighten up food, including heavy meals.
