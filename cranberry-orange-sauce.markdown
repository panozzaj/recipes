## Overview

Total Time: 20 minutes

Prep Time: 5 minutes

Cook Time: 15 minutes

Yield: 3 cups

## Ingredients

1/4 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
Zest of 1 orange
~1/2 cup sugar, to taste
1 (12-ounce) bag fresh cranberries

## Directions

In a medium saucepan, combine orange juice, orange zest, sugar and 3/4 cup
water over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has
dissolved. Stir in cranberries and bring to a boil; reduce heat and let simmer
until sauce has thickened, about 15 minutes. Let cool completely before
serving.

## Notes

Good for Thanksgiving to counter the typical canned sauce. Less sugar too probably, although I like a bit of sourness. Got the original idea from the Terry wedding. In 2017 I added like one star anise and thought it turned out really well.
