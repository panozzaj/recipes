Easy mode would be to just throw all ingredients in and cook for about 20 minutes on high pressure. I typically cook the chicken on high heat to get a little crispiness.

 - Instant pot on saute highest setting
 - Then add chicken (possibly with a little oil (coconut oil is kind of nice)) and spices (salt, pepper, cumin, paprika, taco seasoning, chili powders are good)
 - When chicken is browned but not fully cooked through, set it aside
 - Add some diced onions, stirring to make sure any crispy bits are scraped up from bottom.
 - Can add a little white wine or chicken broth to deglaze as well if needed.
 - Then add some garlic, a jar of mild salsa verde, and add the chicken back in and stir.
 - Pressure cook on high for 20 minutes then quick release.

Can add canned black beans if desired, just drain the can and rinse
Can also add rice, just add ~2.5C of chicken broth / stock per 1 C of rice. Rice should be submerged.
