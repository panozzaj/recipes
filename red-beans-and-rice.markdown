## Ingredients
 * 1 pound red kidney beans, dry
 * 1 large onion, chopped
 * 1 bell pepper, chopped
 * 5 ribs celery, chopped
 * As much garlic as you like, minced (I like lots, 5 or 6 cloves)
 * 1 large smoked ham hock, 3/4 pound of Creole-style pickle meat (pickled pork), or 3/4 lb. smoked ham, diced, for seasoning
 * 1 to 1-1/2 pounds mild or hot smoked sausage or andouille, sliced on the bias
 * 1/2 to 1 tsp. dried thyme leaves, crushed
 * 1 or 2 bay leaves
 * As many dashes Crystal hot sauce or Tabasco as you like, to taste
 * A few dashes Worcestershire sauce
 * Creole seasoning blend, to taste; OR,
    * red pepper and black pepper to taste
 * Salt to taste
 * Fresh Creole hot sausage or chaurice, links or patties, grilled or pan-fried, one link or patty per person (optional)
 * Pickled onions (optional)

## Directions

Soak the beans overnight, if possible. The next day, drain and put fresh water in the pot. (This helps reduce the, um, flatulence factor.) Bring the beans to a rolling boil. Make sure the beans are always covered by water, or they will discolor and get hard. Boil the beans for about 45 - 60 minutes, until the beans are tender but not falling apart. Drain.

While the beans are boiling, sauté the Trinity (onions, celery, bell pepper) until the onions turn translucent. Add the garlic and saute for 2 more minutes, stirring occasionally. After the beans are boiled and drained, add the sautéed vegetables to the beans, then add the ham hock (or ham or pickle meat), smoked sausage, seasonings, and just enough water to cover.

Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a low simmer. Cook for 2 hours at least, preferably 3, until the whole thing gets nice and creamy. Adjust seasonings as you go along. Stir occasionally, making sure that it doesn't burn and/or stick to the bottom of the pot. (If the beans are old -- say, older than six months to a year -- they won't get creamy. Make sure the beans are reasonably fresh. If it's still not getting creamy, take 1 or 2 cups of beans out and mash them, then return them to the pot and stir.)

If you can ... let the beans cool, stick them in the fridge, and reheat and serve for dinner the next day. They'll taste a LOT better. When you do this, you'll need to add a little water to get them to the right consistency.

Serve generous ladles-ful over hot white long-grain rice, with good French bread and good beer. I also love to serve grilled or broiled fresh Creole hot sausage or chaurice on the side. Do not serve with a canned-beet salad, like my Mom always used to do. (Sorry, Mom ... try something interesting with fresh beets and we'll talk. :^)

I like serving a few small pickled onions with my red beans -- I chop them up and mix them in with the beans. It's great! Why does it taste so good? As my sister's friend (and dyed-in-the-wool New Orleanian) Cherie Valenti would say ... "It's da vineguh!"

YIELD: 8 servings

## My thoughts

AJP: I used canned beans, and it worked out fine.  Maybe a little more sodium, but a lot easier.  Used some spicy red sausage from Kroger.  Was easily one of the best things that I have made, I would consider serving this to other people.

AP part 2: I have also used dried beans now with this recipe. Makes it pretty good as well, just takes some more work. I still really like this recipe. It does not taste like Popeye's RB&R, which was my inspiration, but still pretty good.
