# Lamb stuffed peppers

I came up with this recipe after reading through a few online and combining them. Thought it turned out really well! Flavor blends are kind of Greek and kind of Italian.

## Ingredients

- 5 bell peppers (green and red are nice)
- 1 lb. ground lamb meat
- olive oil
- 1/4 onion
- a spoonful of minced garlic
- some cooked rice
- crumbled feta cheese (1 small package, tomato blend would be good)
- 3/4 jar pasta sauce (I used three cheese blend)
- fresh dill
- spices like salt, pepper, smoked paprika, oregano, maybe herbes de provance, crushed red pepper, chipotle pepper

## Directions

1. At some point, cut tops of peppers off and remove seeds and membranes. Keep the tops of the peppers.
1. Cook lamb meat in skillet. Do not overcook since it will be heated again. Season with salt, pepper, paprika. Drain liquid/fat when finished.
1. In that pan, remove any meat, rinse gently and add olive oil. Cook onions for a little while until soft, then add garlic and cook for like 20 seconds and remove from heat.
1. In a bowl, combine most of the feta cheese with the meat, garlic/onion, pasta sauce, chopped dill (< 1 sprig), spices, rice.
1. Spoon mixture into peppers, top with reserved cheese, and then put the top back on.
1. Cook on grill or in oven for a little while.

Note: some sun-dried tomatoes would not be bad either
