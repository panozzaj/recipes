# Pressure Cooker Quick White Fish Meal

This is one that I made up. Basically the idea is that you are going to layer the instant pot so that the stuff at the bottom cooks in liquid, and then stuff higher up from it will steam. You don't need a rack if you layer it properly. This is a pretty ideal weekday meal since you just throw a few things in and it is done!

## Method

1. Cut potatoes in small chunks. Maybe quartering for small red potatoes. Cut enough to layer the bottom of the instant pot where you can't see the bottom. Add salt, garlic, and a little butter, and maybe a little spice that is good for potatoes (thyme, paprika, dill, etc.)
2. Add about 1/2 C of liquid. To add most flavor, I recommend chicken broth / stock. Mix with potatoes. You can turn on saute mode at this point if you want. This might seem like too little liquid but I've found it to be OK.
3. Next, layer in some other vegetable or vegetables. I like green beans. You can use carrots, leafy greens like kale, etc. Don't mix with potatoes, you want these on top. Again, you want a good layer. Add some salt and a little butter. Can also put a little more garlic if you want.
4. Last, put 3-4 white fish (tilapia, etc.) fillets on top. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. You might want paprika or some other seasonings (I like dill). Put a dollop of butter on each fillet, and either lemon slices (squeezed) or squeezed lemon juice on top of each fish.
5. Cook under high pressure. 2-3 minutes if the fish is not frozen, and 3-4 minutes if it is frozen. Quick release. This sounds surprisingly fast, but the pressure cooks quickly. If for some reason the food was not done, could saute more after finishing.

It might be more flavorful to saute the potatoes for a bit with onions to get them a little crispy. But that might take away from the ease of preparation of the dish.
