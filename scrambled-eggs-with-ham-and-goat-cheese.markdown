# Scrambled Eggs with Ham and Goat Cheese

I have made these probably 10 times now, and think I have it where it's pretty repeatable and delicious.

## Ingredients

- Ham, cut thinly (deli meat works fine)
- Goat cheese
- Eggs
- Butter or other oil
- Paprika / mustard / black pepper / salt

## Directions

1. Fry ham in butter in a non-stick skillet. Add black pepper and smoked paprika
2. While that is browning up, scramble 3-5 eggs (it goes quickly) in a bowl with some salt, a squirt or two of mustard (ideally spicy brown), and a splash of milk
3. Reduce the heat of the pan and add the egg mixture, stirring immediately since the pan is hot
4. Thereafter, stir occasionally until nearly done, then add a few dollops of goat cheese. Ideally you will get a few clumps that are not as melted and a few others that are more melted
