# Scrambled Eggs with Ham and Goat Cheese

I have made these probably 10 times now, and think I have it where it's pretty repeatable and delicious.

## Ingredients

- Ham, cut thinly (deli meat works fine)
- Goat cheese
- Eggs
- Butter or other oil
- Paprika / mustard / black pepper / salt

## Directions

1. Fry ham in butter in a non-stick skillet. Add black pepper and smoked paprika
2. While that is browning up, scramble 3-5 eggs (it goes quickly) in a bowl with some salt, a squirt or two of mustard (ideally spicy brown), and a little milk
3. Reduce the heat of the pan and add the egg mixture, stirring immediately since the pan is hot
4. Thereafter, stir occasionally until nearly done, then add a few dollops of goat cheese. Ideally you will get a few clumps that are not as melted and a few others that are more melted
